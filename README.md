### 4. Deploying to AWS
- Manual via AWS Console (upload ZIPs)
- AWS CLI (recommended for repeatability)
- SAM / Serverless Framework (optional for infrastructure-as-code)

### Example Manual Deployment Steps:
1. Zip the Lambda code:
    ```bash
    cd server/submit_help_request
    zip -r function.zip .
    ```

2. Upload the ZIP to AWS Lambda via the Console or:
    ```bash
    aws lambda update-function-code \
      --function-name SubmitHelpRequest \
      --zip-file fileb://function.zip
    ```

### 5. API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                         | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| POST   | `/submit-help-request`          | Submit a new request for help   |
| GET    | `/fetch-requests`               | View all open help requests     |
| POST   | `/signup` / `/login` (optional) | User registration/login (Cognito) |

All endpoints are routed through **API Gateway** and trigger their corresponding **Lambda functions**.

### 6. Security Notes
- All secrets are stored in AWS Lambda environment variables
- Never store credentials in code
- All endpoints are served over HTTPS via API Gateway
- Cognito used for secure login
